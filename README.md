Java ATM System Design and Implementation
Project Overview:
Designed and implemented a comprehensive ATM system in Java, focusing on account management, financial transactions, and currency conversions. The system was built with a modular approach, encapsulating core functionalities like deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and transaction reversals.

Key Responsibilities:

Class Design and Implementation: Developed classes for handling various ATM operations, such as Account, Deposit, Withdraw, and BalanceInquiry. Each class included an execute method to perform the respective operation and a cancelTransaction method to reverse the operation.

Currency Handling: Implemented currency conversion within the BalanceInquiry class, allowing users to view their balance in different currencies (USD and Euro).

User Interaction and Testing: Created a user-friendly menu-driven interface for testing the classes, enabling users to:

Enter and manage account details.
Perform deposits and withdrawals.
Inquire about the current balance in different currencies.
Cancel the last transaction to revert any changes.
Code Quality: Ensured the implementation was modular, maintainable, and adhered to object-oriented principles.

Technologies Used: Java, OOP principles
